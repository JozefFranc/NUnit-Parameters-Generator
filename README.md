# NUnit-Parameters-Generator
Generate parameters for NUnit tests

## Intro
When you need create better unit tests or just want tests all possibilities, usually you finish with parametriyed tests. Sometimes creating TestCase-s is more complicated and you found NUnit generators. It has great possibilities, but creating generator which generate all possible parameters combination isn't easy at all.
This is exactly the point where you need avoid complexity of generators and simply create generator. Intention of this library is simplifing creation of test generators.

## Concept
Testing all combination of parameters is one possible way. But how to generate all possible combination?
Do you what is mechanical counter?
